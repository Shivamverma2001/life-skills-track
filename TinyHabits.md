## Question 5
## What is the book's perspective about Identity?
When trying to form new habits, it's crucial to think about oneself differently, according to James Clear's book "Atomic Habits". The book advises you to alter how you view yourself rather than concentrating just on what you want to accomplish. It entails seeing oneself as someone who already practices the positive behaviors you aspire to, such as eating well and exercising frequently. Because you feel that such behaviors are just a natural part of who you are, it is simpler to maintain them. The book essentially suggests that altering your self-perception is the first step in changing your habits.
