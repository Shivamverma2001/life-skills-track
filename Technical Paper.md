# Event Sourcing Architecture

An architectural design pattern used in the creation of software is event sourcing. In contrast to conventional techniques like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activities, it offers an alternate strategy for maintaining the state of an application. Instead of merely tracking the current state, Event Sourcing allows you to save an application's state as a series of immutable events. This method provides a number of advantages, including auditability, scalability, and the capacity to produce many data perspectives.

## Core Concepts:

+ ### Events: 
 Events are permanent recordings of actions taken inside the program. These occurrences signify state changes in the system. Events provide details on what occurred, who brought about the change when it happened, and any other pertinent information.
+ ### Event Store: 
 An application's events are stored in the Event Store, a permanent data repository. It adds fresh events to the event stream's conclusion. Your system's aggregates and entities will each have their own event streams.
+ ### Aggregate: 
For data updates, an aggregate is a domain object or a collection of domain objects that are handled as a single entity. Business state and logic are contained in aggregates. The only way to modify an aggregate is to create new events.

## Workflow:

The Event Sourcing architecture works in the following way

+ ### Write Side:
   The program creates an event that details changes when they happen. The event store has these events tagged to it. Events must be noted and made sure to be persistent on the write side.

+ ### Read Side:
  Based on the events in the event store, the application maintains one or more projections or read models. These predictions may be tailored for different read conditions, which facilitates efficient reporting and querying. The read side is in charge of giving the application's users views and data.
+ ### Replay:
  By playing back events from the event store, Event Sourcing enables you to recreate the application's present state. For debugging, auditing, and dealing with problems like data corruption, this is especially helpful.

## Benefits of Event Sourcing:

+ ### Auditability:
   Since all changes to the application state are recorded as events, you have a detailed audit trail of everything that has happened in the system.

+ ### Temporal Querying:
  You can query the state of the system at any point in time, which can be valuable for historical reporting and analysis.

+ ### Scalability:
  Event sourcing can improve the scalability of an application by enabling different views of the data to be created and maintained separately. Each projection can be optimized for its specific use case.
  
+ ### Resilience:
  Event Sourcing makes it easier to recover from failures. You can reconstruct the state of the application by replaying events.

+ ### Flexibility:
  It allows for evolving the application state over time without compromising the integrity of historical data.

## Challenges:

+ ### Complexity:
  Event Sourcing can introduce complexity, both in terms of development and maintenance. Implementing the read side and ensuring consistency between the write and read sides can be challenging.

+ ### Performance:
  Replaying events to construct the current state can be resource-intensive, so optimizing this process is important.

+ ### Learning Curve:
  Developers and teams new to Event Sourcing may face a learning curve, as it represents a different way of thinking about application state.

## Use Cases:

Event Sourcing is particularly useful in scenarios where auditability, compliance, and the ability to derive multiple views of data are crucial, such as financial systems, healthcare, and complex business processes.

## Summary

In summary, Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern that focuses on capturing and preserving the history of changes in an application by using immutable events. It offers benefits like auditability, temporal querying, and scalability, but it also introduces complexity and requires careful implementation to reap its advantages effectively.
